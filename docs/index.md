## Animated boxplot for alcohol consumption
We wanted to see if there was a difference in alcohol consumption between developed and developing nations.
We plotted this data as a boxplot animated over time as shown:
![Animated boxplot for alcohol consumption](resources/animated_boxplot_alcohol.gif)
We can see that people in developed nations drink considerably more than people in developing nations.
We speculate that this is due to people having less access to alcohol.

## Animated boxplot for life expectancy
We also checked how life expectancies compare between developed and developing countries.
As before, we use an animated boxplot to show this.
![Animated boxplot for life expectancy](resources/animated_boxplot_life_expectation.gif)
We see that developing nations have a significantly lower life expectancy than developed nations.
We think this is caused by a wide range of factors including quality of healthcare, working conditions, water access, and prevalence of deadly diseases.
