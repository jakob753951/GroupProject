## Alcohol consumption v Development status
We wanted to see if there was a difference in alcohol consumption between developed and developing nations.
We plotted this data as a boxplot animated over time as shown:
![Animated boxplot for alcohol consumption](resources/animated_boxplot_alcohol.gif)

We can see that people in developed nations drink considerably more than people in developing nations.
We speculate that this is due to people in developing nations having less access to alcohol.

## Life expectancy v Development status
We also checked how life expectancies compare between developed and developing countries.
As before, we use an animated boxplot to show this.

![Animated boxplot for life expectancy](resources/animated_boxplot_life_expectation.gif)

We see that developing nations have a significantly lower life expectancy than developed nations.
We think this is caused by a wide range of factors including quality of healthcare, working conditions, water access, and prevalence of deadly diseases.
